# VulnerableRouterScanner
A free tool to automatically scan for the current router on a network, with an in-build database of default logins you can add to.
## Features

This app for android is a basic search automation tool for finding a routers default gateway, and then checking a database for a list of usernames and passwords, as routers are often left with the default logins. As you use this app more, you will be able to add passwords and usernames for router pages that you come accross, so that in the future, if you come across them again, it will recognise them! (It does this through computing a hash of the webpage that the router uses to ID the router in question, so unfortunently it is not universal).

## Issues

Please feel free to, through the issues tab, submit router pages that are currently not part of the "default" database of usernames and passwords, as i only own 1 router, and it being expanded is quite useful! Before you submit an issue, please install android studio and compile the app yourself, using debug mode to check exactly what error you are experiencing, as it makes fixing things much easier!

## Installation

Please see the "Releases" tab for .apk pre-compiled versions of this app.

If you want to compile this app yourself, please see the /Source/ directory, then drag the folder inside into your AndroidStudioProjects folder.  (C:/Users/[username]/AndroidStudioProjects/ for me)
